# Project Proposal: Load Balancer with Dynamic Algorithm Selection Using POX and Mininet in an SDN Environment

## Project Description and Rationale:
This project aims to implement a load balancer using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles, with a specific focus on the POX SDN controller and the Mininet network emulator. The rationale behind this project is to explore how SDN can enhance network performance through load balancing and gain practical experience in SDN application development. This project will include the ability to dynamically select and run different load balancing algorithms.

## Specific Goals and Targets:
1. **Load Balancing Logic**: Develop and implement multiple load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) within the POX SDN controller to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers.

2. **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: Create a dynamic configuration method that allows users to select and switch between different load balancing algorithms during runtime.

3. **Flow Rule Definition**: Use the OpenFlow protocol supported by the POX controller to define flow rules for directing network packets to backend servers based on the selected load balancing algorithm.

4. **Basic Testing**: Conduct initial testing using Mininet to verify that the load balancer performs load distribution correctly for each selected algorithm.

5. **Documentation**: Create concise project documentation that covers architecture, design decisions, and usage instructions for the load balancer with dynamic algorithm selection.

6. **User Interface (UI) Development**: Develop a user-friendly web-based UI that allows users to configure, monitor, and interact with the load balancer, including dynamic algorithm selection.

## Tentative Timeline with Clear Goals and Targets:
- **Week 1**: Project setup, research on load balancing algorithms, initial design of the network topology.
- **Week 2**: Implementation of load balancing logic for multiple algorithms, dynamic algorithm selection, and the beginning of testing.
- **Week 3**: Continued testing, UI development, and configuration method.
- **Week 4**: Final testing, refinement, documentation completion, and project wrap-up.

## How the Project Relates to the Field of "Computer Networks":
This project aligns with the field of computer networks by addressing the fundamental concept of load balancing within SDN. It demonstrates the potential of SDN technologies in providing flexible and dynamic load balancing solutions for various network scenarios.
